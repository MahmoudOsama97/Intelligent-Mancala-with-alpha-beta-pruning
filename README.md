## Game description: 
Mancala is a generic name for a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's pieces.
## Implementation description:
We choose suitable representation for the game and implemented show and initialize function as utility function for it, then we implemented the game rule for Human player and tested it separately by player vs player mode, then we start implementing the algorithm of Min-Max with alpha-beta pruning by using recursion.
## Bonus features:
1) Implement an iterative-deepening variation of the alpha-beta algorithm.
2) Support various difficulty levels corresponding to different game tree depths.
3) Support game saving and loading.
